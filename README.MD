# Touran Malecki Simulator

This program is a fun racing game with 2D view written in C# 

## Project assumptions and ideas 

My idea for that game was to make a racing game with many obstacles coming out on straight road. Diferent stages of the game are divided more or less by the music - when there are some slower moments in the game, another stage is about to start. During those slower parts a user can read what obstacles he should expect.

The car can be driven by direction keys - left or right. User can choose four lanes. Space bar is the boost key that is not available from the beginning of the game.

The user's car looks like that:

One of the obstacle is police car, looks like that:

Second obstacle is a cow:

The game should last till the end of the song, but still i have some obstacles left to add.
